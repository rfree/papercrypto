Here we describe Paper Crypto OTP (one time pad).

This is the perfect (impossible to break it without password) encryption protocol that 
allows 2 people to contact eachother in most secure as possible way, that:
1) can't be broken, because it's one-time password as long as the message
2) can be coded/decoded with no electronical devices, with pen and paper - no backdoors
3) uses special shortcuts and codes to be shorter (quicker to encode/decode)

Encryption formula is trivial: a+b=c. Decryption is: c-b=a.
a=plain text, b=password (one-time pad "password" pre-shared), c=cypher text.

In practice we use not digits, but alphabet of e.g. 48 characters:

Alphabet(type48): ABCDEFGHiJKLMNoPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789^?!.*+-/=@$:
Entropy source for onetime pad: 6dice * 8dice, or 6dice*coin*coin*coin
Encryption implementation: paper table for encode (48rows*48columns)

THE ENCRYPTION SYSTEM

Code is one time pad.

It's like simple shift code (rot), but it uses other rotation amount for EACH CHARACTER which turns such code
from totally worthless into absolutelly unbreakable (by any analysis of the crypto text).

Encode: B+D -> E,  Decode: E-D -> B
B is clear text,
D is pad (in this position)
E is encrypted text (that can be send over computers, internet, etc)
E is again received encrypted
D is again pad (a copy that recipient had pre-shared over secure channel - in person)
B is decoded clear text

Text example:
Text="Hello", Pad="ACDBF":

"HELLO" + "ACDBF" = "HGOMT"
"HGOMT"   - "ACDBF" = "HELLO"
@TODO

Alphabet used has 48 characters:

ABCDEFGHiJKLMNoPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789^?!.*+-/=@$:

THE SHORTCUTS SYSTEM
Examples:

journalists reporting from war front can send following CLEAR text (just using shortcuts)
"IDCAN/GET/REPORTP^^" - means: "urgent: all is going good. yes we can get this report done. Just waiting your confirmation."
"EJHE/WILL/LEAVER^^" - means: "immediate: all is good, but: he will leave. We should do it! Just awaiting your confirmation!"

u-boot captain (clear text examples):
1) "FAFUEL/HAS/LOW/EFFIC?^^" 
2) "IWFUEL/WILL/RUN/IN/50/N.M./RDVZ/W/BISMARCK/$G53.9704,5.6603/F^^"
3) "EZCAPTURED@^^"

1) means: urgent: I suspect that: (good, but we have a considaration that...) fuel has low efficiency. Please reply"
2) means: Asap, I am sure that: (we have a problem, sorry my fault) fuel will run in 50 n.m. Randveouz with Bismarck geolocation 53.9704,5.6603. 
Do it soon. Awaiting your reply. We are also working on it / doing something about it.
3) means: Immediate, I'm sure that: (trouble) caputred. Tell everyone. Might be unable to communicate.


more urgent (afar waiting for reply maybe):
E J "HE/WILL/LEAVE/SOON/MUST/REPORT/NOW" R^^
EJHE/WILL/LEAVE/SOON/MUST/REPORT/NOWR^^
EJHE/WILL/LEAVER^^ -> "he will leave" + contex = "he will leave [soon!] [we must must do it!] awaiting your confirmation!"

business:
NLWE/BUY/CARS/1000/PIECE/IN/NOV+^^
means:
We should do it really at some point: I want to offer/invite you to something very interesting: we buy cars 1000 piece in nov. I invite you and await your reply.

Message format is:
1 character, 1 character, N characters, 1 character, 2 characters "^^" with meaning:
(mode) (tone) (main body) (ending-type)^^ so for example:
(urgent, I am sure) (all is going good :) "yes we can get this report done" (just waiting your confirmation) 
will be encoded as:
I D "YES/WE/CAN/GET/REPORT/DONE" P^^
using the tables below to find meaning of symbols I,D, and P^^.

IDYES/WE/CAN/GET/REPORT/DONEP^^
more urgent (afar waiting for reply maybe):
E J "HE/WILL/LEAVE/SOON/MUST/REPORT/NOW" R^^
EJHE/WILL/LEAVE/SOON/MUST/REPORT/NOWR^^
EJHE/WILL/LEAVER^^ -> "he will leave" + contex = "he will leave [soon!] [we must must do it!] awaiting your confirmation!"



Use case (historical needs for crypto and current events):
- journalists reporting events to HQ:
- whistleblower reporting: police corruption, being compromised, being framed, 
- various war officers
- U-boot officers - reporting position, reporting damage, reporting request for resupply :)
- banking secrets - e.g. scheduel of convoy with gold/paper money
- USA funding fathers - could organize this way if their long-distance communication would be intercepted
- software developer forced by totalitarian regime to backdoor his software and be quiet about it (e.g. the "gag-order" in UK)
- boy-scouts against occupant army - supply location...

<start> <main-text> <end>

start is usually 2 characters, sometimes more
end is usually 3 characters


=== GENERAL TEXT ===
In general text:

. is used to end sentance or as dot
/ is used as space
^ before letter means upper-case latter
* can mean shortcut

=== START TEXT ====

First 2 characters mean message type/tone, you read their meaning from tables below.
In example 2 characters "EW" eans "Immediate! I am very sure; Bad situation, sorry;"

Some examples (look at first 2 chars)
EWU/HAVE/BAD/FUEL - 

So "EWU/HAVE/BAD/FUEL^^" means.
"Immediate! I am very sure; Bad situation, sorry; U have bad fuel."
U being common shortcut for You. 
Therefore it is urgent warning that uboot took wrong fuel at the port.

Letter 1 encodes usually how URGENT is the message.
Letter 2 encodes usually how SURE you are

urgent: [4] -1,0,1,+1 low..normal..high..immediate
being sure/please do it/you must:  -2,-1(not so sure),0(normal),1(please),2(must),3(absolutelly!)

A - emergency! I suspect that...
B - emergency! I have some small doubt, but probably... / a suggestion   
C - emergency! Normal information: From what I know / I think that...
D - emergency! I am sure! We should do it now, please do it quickly!
E - emergency! I am very sure! We MUST absolutelly do it now!
F - emergency question! I ask very urgently, is this true that ... /should we ...

G - urgent. I suspect that...
H - urgent. I have some small doublt, but probably... / a suggestion
I - urgent. Normal information: From what I know / I think that...
J - urgent. I am sure. We should do it really soon if you can, please do it soon.
K - urgent. I am very sure! We MUST do it really soon.
L - urgent question. I ask urgently, is this true that ... /should we ...

M - normal. I suspect that...
N - normal. I have some small doublt, but probably... / a suggestion
O - normal. Normal information: From what I know / I think that...
P - normal. I am sure. We should do it really at some point.
Q - normal. I am very sure! We MUST do it at some point.
R - normal question. I ask, is this true that ... /should we ...

S - marginal. I suspect that...
T - marginal. I have some small doubt, but probably... / a suggestion
U - marginal. Normal information: From what I know / I think that...
W - marginal. I am sure. We should do it really - one day in future.
X - marginal. I am very sure! We MUST do it - one day in future.
Y - marginal question. Please tell later, is this true that ... /should we ...

Next letter is if speciall characeter then has meaning:
! - update, errata, instead of previous message:
* - continuation of previous message, append to previous message

$g - geo location
$p - pgp/gnupg key information. $P1234ABCD/ means "pgp key 0x1234ABCD "
$b - bitcoin etc address. $B1^Y^ABUP54/ means "bitcoin address [starting with] 1YAbup54
$k - KSK@ key. $B$KRND5858 means "bitcoin adddress that can be found in KSK@rnd5858" {remember that this information will show cleartext bitcoin address on computer; though using bitcoin will probably require one anyway}

Ending texts, the last 3 characters at end of message (before ^^) have speciall meaning:


=======================================================================
=======================================================================
=== FONT ===

We recommend to write insted of big chars "i" and "o" small chars because big chars are very similar with digits 1 and 0,
and write very carefully the letter "S" and the digit "5" because we have same sytuation, there are very similar chars. 
Remember about clearly writing chars ". - ^".
