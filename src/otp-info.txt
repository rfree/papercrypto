Here we describe Paper Crypto OTP (one time pad).

I. Encryption of text into cyphertext: one-time-pad.
II. First we shorten the text with tables of common shortcuts for phrases, contexts.
III. There is no step III: all is ready to send even over insecure channel, email, mail, sms.

I. Encryption

This is the *perfect* (impossible to break it without password) encryption protocol that 
allows 2 people to contact eachother in most secure as possible way, that:
1) can't be broken, because it's one-time password as long as the message
2) can be coded/decoded with no electronical devices, with pen and paper - no backdoors

Encryption formula is trivial: a+b=c. Decryption is: c-b=a.
a=plain text, b=password (one-time pad "password" pre-shared), c=cypher text.

In practice we use not digits, but alphabet of e.g. 48 characters:

Alphabet(type48): ABCDEFGHiJKLMNoPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789^?!.*+-/=@$:
Entropy source for onetime pad: 6dice * 8dice, or 6dice*coin*coin*coin
Encryption implementation: paper table for encode (48rows*48columns)

II. Shortening and format of the message.

You can just write text with no encoding, then we recommend to start with 
character "=" to indicate such no-format version. Example: 
"=URGENT!I HAVE A QUESTION.ALL IS GOOD BUT I AM CONCERNED.DO YOU HAVE FUEL LEFT
?IF NOT THEN EITHER BUY NOW OR RETURN TO BASE, OR AT EVERY LEAST CONSERVE IT.PLEASE REPLY ASAP"
with shortcuts it becomes:
"PB::APFUEL::AQABUY NOW:RETURN TO BASE:CONSERVE IT!^^"

Which cuts work time to decrypt message from 15 to 5 minutes.

In such Message we want to encode shortly following information:
1a) message priority - is it urgent (to decode, to read)
1b) message certanity - is it a suggesion, a statement, an order or question...
2) message tone - is this good, are there troubles; trying to make a plan...
3) the message text
4) the ending form - do you await reply, or not; do you expect us to do something;

Length in characters: 1a+1b are in one char, 2 is one, 4 takes three.

There exist also tiny-message and small-messages that are shorter, eg:

P^ - Tiny message - "All is normal".
P+^ - Small message "Yes."
TODO


=================================================================
Tiny message: (just this 2 exists now):
1 letter + 1 ending "^", eg:
P^ "All is normal."
F^ "(urgent) I wait for reply."

=================================================================
Small message has 2 charactes and 1 ending "^":
Small message's 1st-character means priority+certanity of message.
P+^ "Yes."
Q+^ "Yes!"
E+^ "(urgent) Yes, certainly!"
K+^ "(urgent) Yes, certainly!!!"
F+^ "(urgent) Do you think so?"
There are over 20 options, detailed in table TABLE_PRIO_CERTAIN below.

Small message's 2nd-character can mean predefined tiny-text like +="Yes", -="No".
P+^ "Yes."
P-^ "No."
P=^ "No, but maybe later."
P/^ "No, sorry."
all are listed in TABLE_CONTEXT

Small message uses both characters:
E/^ "(urgent) Certainly no! sorry."
E+^ "(urgent) Certainly Yes!"
H+^ "(urgent) I gueest that: yes."

=================================================================
Normal message has 2 characters, (then text), and 3 ending in form "_^^".

Normal message's 1st-character is same priority+certanity (TABLE_PRIO_CERTAIN).
Normal message's 2st-character means the context of message (TABLE_CONTEXT).
And then text follows.
At end you have 3 ending characters: end-type character and then "^^".
End-type characters are listed in TABLE_END_CHAR.

The message text is normal text of any length, you read it after your encounter 
characters ^^, the 2 dashes mark end, and then last character before was part of the 
3 char end marker described in TABLE_END_CHAR.

Inside text message: 
/   means space
//  means new line.
^   is upper case for the next character after it. 
^@  or shorter = means special char e.g. national ^@a is ą
^@^ or shorter =^ means special and uppercase ^@^a is Ą 

:@...@ means special format, opened with :@ and ended with another @, as:
:@G+52.51/-59.19@ is geoposition with lang/long
:@O3G2UPL4PQ6KUFC4M@ in [http://?]3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion (which is DuckDuckGo hidden server)
:@Kfoobar@ means Freenet KSK key (not secure! maybe with 15+ char but encrypt it)
:@PABCD1234@ means PGP key with keyid ABCD1234 (we recommend last 16 characters, not just 8)
:@Izzz@ means i2p addressa [http://?]zzz.i2p/
:@Wdebian.org@ is a regular web-page.
:@B...@ is a bitcoin address. Encode upper letters with ^.
:@B:ltc:...@ is an bitcoin-like altcoin address, for LTC coin
:@B:doge:1gsjfidfdsds@ for example, is an dogecoin address

=================================================================
TABLE_PRIO_CERTAIN

=================================================================
TABLE_CONTEXT
This is usually 2nd character - or a small-message.
This character endodes Context, or sometimes a tiny-message.
Context means the general tone of sentance to make you understand what message means.

It can mean a small-message: 

+ as in "P+^^" means YES.
P+^^ YES.
P/^^ NO, sorry.
P=^^ NO, but maybe later/at other occasion.
P-^^ NO.
P?^^ I did not decided, I do not know.
P:^^ I did not decided yet, but I will think more about it probably.
P*^^ I am fine either/any way.
P!^^ I do not understand.

Or it can set context / tone of the message:

Tone of the text:
A - small problems possible (a bit worried)
B - I am neutral; general text; no mood specified
C - good :)
D - good :) thank you :)
E - good :) after all / despite problems / thanks to me
F - good, though some problem or consideration
G - all very good :D
H - all very good :D thank you :D
I - all very good :D after all / despite problems / thanks to me
J - all very good :D, though some problem or consideration
K - I want to offer/invite you to something 
L - I want to offer/invite you to something very interesting :)
M - mixed (good and bad)
W - bad situation - sorry (my/our fault) :(
X - bad situation - angry (at you) :(
Y - bad situation - angry (not at you) :(
Z - bad situation - :(
1 - be viggilant / watch out
2 - tretchery by someone we (probably both) trusted
3 - technical compromise 
4 - compromise including problems with this crypto (e.g. my crypto was stolen?)
5 - we must change communication channel/crypto

=================================================================
TABLE_END_CHAR

The last 3 characters (usually) mean some summary of the communication
and it's status at end.

^^^ - normal end of communication, communication channel open.
.^^ - normal end of communication, I consider this matter closed/done.
?^^ - please reply
!^^ - please reply soon
+^^ - I invite you and await your reply {business, polite}
A^^ - if you want please do <as we discussed>, if you want contact me
B^^ - please do <as we discussed>, awaiting your reply when you are ready
C^^ - please! do <as we discussed>, awaiting your soon reply asap
D^^ - if you want please do <as we discussed>, if you want contact me - I work on it too
E^^ - please do <as we discussed>, awaiting your reply when you are ready - I work on it too
F^^ - please! do <as we discussed>, awaiting your soon reply asap - I work on it too
J^^ - I will continue
K^^ - I will take care about it
L^^ - I will take care about it all, do not worry
M^^ - Let's together work on it
P^^ - I can do it, awaiting your confirmation/authorization
R^^ - I think we should do it quickly, just awaiting your confirmation
=^^ - please take care about it for me, do everything needed, let everyone know
@^^ - please take care about it for me, do everything needed, let everyone know, I might have trouble communicating

=================================================================
Begining and ending examples.

Same message text can mean various things depending on how you say it.

Examples: based on "I WORK WITH MARK"

I/WORK/WITH/MARK
I/WORK/WITH/MARK
I/WORK/WITH/MARK?^^^
I/WORK/WITH/MARK?^^^

"I work with Mark :( (and this sucks)"
"I work with Mark :) (and this is good)"
"I work with Mark :D (and this is very good thing)"
