The clear text usually translated to a Message. 
In such Message we want to encode shortly following information:
1a) message priority - is it urgent (to decode, to read)
1b) message certanity - is it a suggesion, a statement, an order or question...
2) message tone - is this good, are there troubles; trying to make a plan...
3) the message text
4) the ending form - do you await reply, or not; do you expect us to do something;

There exist also tiny-message and small-messages that are shorter.

=================================================================
Tiny message: (just this 2 exists now):
1 letter + 1 ending "^", eg:
P^ "All normal."
F^ "(urgent) I wait for reply."

=================================================================
Small message has 2 charactes and 1 ending "^":
Small message's 1st-character means priority+certanity of message.
P+^ "Yes."
Q+^ "Yes!"
E+^ "(urgent) Yes, certainly!"
K+^ "(urgent) Yes, certainly!!!"
F+^ "(urgent) Do you think so?"
There are over 20 options, detailed in table TABLE_PRIO_CERTAIN below.

Small message's 2nd-character can mean predefined tiny-text like +="Yes", -="No".
P+^ "Yes."
P-^ "No."
P=^ "No, but maybe later."
P/^ "No, sorry."
all are listed in TABLE_CONTEXT

Small message uses both characters:
E/^^ "(urgent) Certainly no! sorry."
E+^^ "(urgent) Certainly Yes!"
H+^^ "(urgent) I gueest that: yes."

=================================================================
Normal message has 2 characters, (then text), and 3 ending in form "_^^".

Normal message's 1st-character is same priority+certanity (TABLE_PRIO_CERTAIN).
Normal message's 2st-character means the context of message (TABLE_CONTEXT).
And then text follows.
At end you have 3 ending characters: end-type character and then "^^".
End-type characters are listed in TABLE_END_CHAR.

Examples:

P+TODAY^^^ "Yes. Today."
P-NO/FUEL^^^ "No, sorry. No fuel."
P=ASK/ALICE?^^ "No, but maybe later. Ask Alice. Please reply."
B=ASK/ALICE?^^ "*(urgent) No, but maybe later. I have a suggestion maybe: Ask Alice. Please reply."


3 letter codes - 1st letter + statement + ^^
P^^ "normal message." = "All is fine / checking in"
R^^ "normal question." = "I wait for reply from you."
F^^ "urgent question!" = "I wait for replu from you!"

1st letter means priorty; and is it statement, suggestion or question.
P+^^ YES (normal message)
C+^^ YES (immediate message)
I+^^ YES (asap message)	



Other 2nd letter means there is a text message;
Inside text message / means space, // means new line.
^ is upper case. @ means special char e.g. national @a=Ä…

PRIO_CERTAIN and CONTEXT.
Demonstration of how PRIO_CERTAIN and CONTEXT can change meaning of same text.
Text is "I/WORK/WITH/MARK" - "I work with Mark".


=================================================================
TABLE_PRIO_CERTAIN

=================================================================
TABLE_CONTEXT
This is usually 2nd character.
This character endodes Context, or sometimes a tiny-message.

can mean various things depending on how you say it:
"I work with Mark :( (and this sucks)"
"I work with Mark :) (and this is good)"
"I work with Mark :D (and this is very good thing)"

P?^^ I did not decided, I do not know.
P:^^ I did not decided yet, but I will think more about it probably.
